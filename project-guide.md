# ITI113 Machine Learning & Operations Project


## Unit Learning Outcomes

- Integrate machine learning knowledge to solve a real-world business problem
- Demonstrate ability to build, deploy and operationalise a practical ML solution
- Build trustworthy machine learning systems with reference to AI governance and responsible AI principles.


## Project Team

You are expected to form a project team of up to 3 members. 

- Each member should take ownership and lead his/her primary or focus area(s) (refer to later sections on descriptions of focus areas)
- Each member should be able to deliver his/her focus area(s) while providing support in other areas, and the team should complete all the associated tasks.
- Each team is expected work professionally and amicably. Marks will be deducted for individuals who rely heavily on others to complete their tasks, and/or for teams that do not work well together.
- The role of the project mentor is to provide guidance on your project proposal and to make sure you are on the right track in your project (not expected to settle disputes or disagreements in teams)

Please fill up the [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD-6n_YYT-DeoNPcEv0u6HoiTz-bfNkQJJaIFh70sArY3prQ/viewform?usp=preview) of your project team members.

|----------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **1 Student** | Full Stack ML | A + B + C + D | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| **2 Students** | Student 1 | Model Development (B) | ✅ Main | ✅ Main | ◑ Support | ◑ Partial | ◑ Model-level (bias, explainability) |

Performance Expectation:
- Each team must demonstrate progress across all components (A–D and AI Governance) at every assessment stage.  
- Larger teams are expected to show greater depth (e.g., multi-model comparison, pipeline automation, monitoring).  
- The expected problem complexity, model performance, and level of detailed analysis and insights should increase proportionally with team size.
- AI Governance must be addressed progressively from risk identification (Proposal) to full implementation (Final Report).

## Project Proposal (20%)

- In the project proposal, your team will pick a business problem of your choice (or from the suggested list of projects) and formulate it as a machine learning problem.
- You are to perform risk assessment of the AI system you are developing. 
- Once you have identified the problem, it can be useful to research on some prior work or research on the related topics. 
- Another important aspect of your project is to identify one or several datasets suitable for your chosen problem. You can either use existing dataset (recommended) or collect the data yourself. (bear in mind the timeframe given that data collection effort may be significant that will impact your project completion schedule)

### Format

Project proposal should include the following information:

- Formulation[[1\]](#_ftn1): Is the problem suited for a ML solution? What is the alternative? Any heuristic you can use?  What are the appropriate success metrics? How do you frame it as machine learning problem? What are the suitable metrics to use for your model? 
- Dataset: What kind of data you need and how do you plan to collect them? If it is some existing dataset (e.g., from Kaggle), include reference link to the dataset and provide some discussion how the data was collected by the author/contributor of the dataset. 
- Discussion of data governance. 
- Methods: What kind of ML approach (e.g., supervised/unsupervised or others) are you planning to use? 
- Deployment: How do you intend to use the model? Provide an overview of how the model is used in the overall solution. You can illustrate this with a system architecture diagram. 
- AI risk assessment 
- Team members and their focus areas

## Progress Check (25%)

### Model Development 

You should have evaluated the suitablity of the data and finalized on the dataset. You are expected to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to gain understanding of the data, and performed data cleaning, transformaion and feature engineering. You will work closely with MLOps team to help setup common data pipeline to be used in development and production. 
A baseline model should have been developed and early experimental results documented, and error analysis performed. You shoud log all the experiments using the experiment tracking facility setup by MLOps team. 

### ML Operations & Deployment 

You should have setup the MLOps platform that allows the modelling team to perform their model development and to track their experiments. You should work closely with the model development team to understand their data requirement and setup the data pipeline to ingest, clean, and transform the data suitable for model training and prediction. You should also have partially setup the MLOps platform such as model registry, and CI/CD platform. You should also work with model development to complete the relevant AI governance checklist at this stage of development.
